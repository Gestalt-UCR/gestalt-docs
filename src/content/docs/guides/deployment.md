In this guide, you will learn how to deploy Gestalt for production using [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/why-google-cloud/). This framework mirrors the original production build for Gestalt, however various components can be replaced based on your needs.
## Prerequisites
- Cloud project with serverless container platform (this guide uses Google Cloud)
- MongoDB database (Note that other databases may be used, however the codebase must be adapted for various databases)
- GitHub account

## Recipe
1. Create a fork of the [Gestalt repository](https://github.com/Gestalt-UCR).
